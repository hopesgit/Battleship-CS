# Battleship

## Summary
This is your generic Battleship clone with the purpose of helping to teach me C#/.NET 

There are some stretch goals/more out-there features that I may include over time. 

Possible features:
* Card-based ship selection
* Card drawing with effects like ship repair, ship duplication, barriers, etc

Known Bugs:
* the player is not able to place any ships other than the battleship
* ship placement validation is limited to whether the cells involved exist and aren't taken
* ship placement does not loop if the placement fails
* the CPU's ship placements are hard-coded
