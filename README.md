# Battleship

## Summary
This is your generic Battleship clone with the purpose of helping to teach me C#/.NET 

There are some stretch goals/more out-there features that I may include over time. 

Possible features:
* Card-based ship selection
* Card drawing with effects like ship repair, ship duplication, barriers, etc
* Full GUI (this will probably require converting the project to a Windows app instead of a console app)

Known Bugs:
* the CPU's ship placements are hard-coded
